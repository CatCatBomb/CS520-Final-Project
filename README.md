# CS520-Final-Project
The final project of Umass CS520.

This project mainly studies a system that uses machine learning technology to predict the winning rate of League of Legends games. The system predicts the winning percentage of the game based on the lineup of both sides before the game starts as input. The models used in the system include binary logistic regression model and multilayer perceptron (neural network) model. The training and test data of the model are obtained by crawling the officially given API through web crawler technology. The model of the system is built with the sklearn library, and 240,000 games have been trained. Therefore, the system implements a system that can analyze the strength of the lineup selected by both sides in the game, so as to predict the winning rate of the game.

Now the System functional requirements analysis has been upload in folder Documents.
